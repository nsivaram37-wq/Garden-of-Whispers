# Garden-of-Whispers
Echoes of Hope: A mental health platform where students share "whispers" in a digital garden. Features a "Lantern" mood tracker and an automated triage system that scans for distress keywords, hiding unsafe posts and routing them to counselors. Built with a rule-based safety net, ready for Gemini API sentiment analysis integration.
